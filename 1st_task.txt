1)Explanation:-The issue is in the reverse_string function where it is returning reversed, as reversed is an inbuilt function and it cannot be returned as a string.
corrected_code:-
def reverse_string(s):
    reversed_string= ""
    for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
        reversed_string+= s[i]
    return reversed_string
def main():
    input_string = "Hello, world!"
    reversed_string = reverse_string(input_string)
    print(f"Reversed string: {reversed_string}")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
2) Explanation: The issue is with comparing a string with a number, as we cannot compare a string with a number.
corrected code:-
def get_age():
    age = input("Please enter your age: ")
    if age.isnumeric():
        Str_age=int(age)
        if(Str_age>18):
            return int(age)
        else:
            return None
def main():
    age = get_age()
    if age:
        print(f"You are {age} years old and eligible.")
    else:
        print("Invalid input. You must be at least 18 years old.")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

3)Explanation: To fix this issue, you should first read the content of the file and store it in a variable, close the file, and then open it in write mode to write the modified content.
Corrected code:
def read_and_write_file(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
        
        with open(filename, 'w') as file:
            file.write(content.upper())
        
        print(f"File '{filename}' processed successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")

def main():
    filename = "sample.txt"
    read_and_write_file(filename)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
4)Explanation: The issue is  it's not returning the sorted array.
corrected code:-
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = arr[:mid]
    right = arr[mid:]
    merge_sort(left)
    merge_sort(right)
    i=j=k=0
    while i<len(left) and j<len(right):
        if left[i]<right[j]:
            arr[k] = left[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            arr[k]=right[j]
            j+=1
        k+=1
    while i<len(left):
        arr[k]=left[i]
        i+=1
        k+=1
    while j<len(right):
        arr[k]=right[j]
        j+=1
        k+=1
    return arr  #returning the array
arr = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
sorted_arr = merge_sort(arr)  
print(f"The sorted array is: {sorted_arr}")
